# WITHackathon

**Project**

Create a predictive model which will take in factors about a natural disaster (location, type etc) and predict what other fires may occur.

**Reason**

The fire department is already overwhelmed dealing with the natural disaster, so we need to minimize the occurrence and impact of any additional fires.

**Goal**

Input via any rudimentary method
Output in any form

**Stretch or Future Goals**

Input via UI - python flask app, R shiny dash etc
Output to include not only predictions but recommendations (both to people and town admin ie shut off power) 

**Files**
