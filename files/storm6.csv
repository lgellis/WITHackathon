Scattered single cell thunderstorms began developing around 3 PM CST from central Kansas northeast into southern Nebraska. The formation of numerous cells quickly resulted in a transition to a multicell convective mode by 4 PM CST. This nearly continuous line of storms lifted north into Nebraska by 530 PM CST. As these storms affected north central Kansas, low-end severe hail occurred from southwest to northeast across Rooks, Osborne, and Jewell Counties. The strongest winds were west of this swath. Phillips County was hit particularly hard as measured wind gusts reached 75 mph in Logan and 71 mph at Phillipsburg. In Phillipsburg, large tree branches were snapped off, knocking out power. The roof was also blown off a restaurant. Scattered thunderstorms continue to develop and move into north central Kansas, at times through the evening and overnight hours, and even into Wednesday morning. None of them were severe until a multicell cluster formed over Lincoln County around 530 AM CST. As this cluster lifted north across Mitchell County, between 645 and 745 AM, they produced 1 inch hail. Other scattered storms developed across the rest of north central Kansas, during the morning hours. They weakened and dissipated, forming a large shield of anvil rain that extended into south central Nebraska. As this rain shield began to dissipate, conditions became favorable for a wake low to form. This resulted in a wind gust of 61 mph at Smith Center, at 1015 AM CST. Repeated thunderstorm activity resulted in swaths of 2 to 3 inches of rain. The highest amount was 3.80 inches in Smith Center.||Low pressure was over South Dakota, and its trailing weak cold front moved into south central Nebraska during the day. It became stationary as low pressure formed over southeast Colorado and deepened to near 990 mb. In the upper-levels, a longwave trough was over the Western U.S. with a ridge over the East. A strong shortwave trough lifted out of the Desert Southwest into the Southern Plains, while a closed low dropped into the Pacific Northwest.

Law Enforcement reported the tornado just south of the county line near Pawnee Rock and then followed it as it moved to the NE.  The tornado moved through the west side of Pawnee Rock causing sporadic EF1 and isolated EF2 damage to several homes and one school type facility.  The tornado continued to move to the NNE causing EF2 damage to a couple of homes on West Barton County Road.  One residence was a mobile home that lost the far east side of the structure and all roofing material.  One injury was noted at that location as they did not seek shelter.  The home just to the west lost the east half of structure with the occupants seeking refuge in the basement.  Of note, a Ford F-150 was thrown or rolled approximately 75 to hundred yards away from its original location.  Further to the NE, the tornado strengthened considerably as noted by complete destruction of an 1890 farm house.  With the age of the home and no anchoring being present due to the structure resting on cinder blocks along with a lack of debarking, a higher rating could not be justified though the amount of devastation to the structure itself pointed towards a possible higher rating.  Three occupants sought refuge in the basement and were unharmed.  The next door neighbor's home was also considerably damaged with all of the structure being demolished except for one corner section. The tornado then continued to the NE over open country damaging trees and power lines along the way before dissipating NW of Hoisington. A total of 44 parcels were affected.

A broken line of severe multicell and supercell thunderstorms developed over central Kansas and was gradually lifting north between 3 and 4 PM CST. North central Kansas had been enshrouded by low stratus overcast through the day. So as these storms encountered this less favorable environment, roughly along and north of Interstate 70, the storms terminated their northward movement and began moving east by 5 PM CST. However, a few new storms developed on the northwest fringe of this activity between 4 and 5 PM CST. The first of these storms formed over Ellis County and moved north through the western portion of the County. This storm continued north and crossed into western Rooks County around 5 PM. It produced severe hail over the southwest part of the County, the largest of which was 1.5 inches. The storm then rapidly weakened.||A cold front had crossed the area on the afternoon and evening of the 17th. This front was stationary near the Kansas-Oklahoma border at dawn on the 18th, with low pressure organizing near the Oklahoma Panhandle. Through the day, the front returned north as a warm front, but only the southeast half of the State made it into the warm sector. In the upper-levels, southwest flow was over the Plains. A low was embedded within a longwave trough over the Western U.S., and was making its way from Utah into Colorado. A shortwave trough orbiting the low was ejecting over the Plains. The storm that produced the severe hail was elevated as the temperature at Hayes, Kansas was only 59 degrees just prior to this storm forming, with winds from the east-northeast at 20 kt, gusting to 26 kt.

A broken line of severe multicell and supercell thunderstorms developed over central Kansas and was gradually lifting north between 3 and 4 PM CST. North central Kansas had been enshrouded by low stratus overcast through the day. So as these storms encountered this less favorable environment, roughly along and north of Interstate 70, the storms terminated their northward movement and began moving east by 5 PM CST. However, a few new storms developed on the northwest fringe of this activity between 4 and 5 PM CST. The first of these storms formed over Ellis County and moved north through the western portion of the County. This storm continued north and crossed into western Rooks County around 5 PM. It produced severe hail over the southwest part of the County, the largest of which was 1.5 inches. The storm then rapidly weakened.||A cold front had crossed the area on the afternoon and evening of the 17th. This front was stationary near the Kansas-Oklahoma border at dawn on the 18th, with low pressure organizing near the Oklahoma Panhandle. Through the day, the front returned north as a warm front, but only the southeast half of the State made it into the warm sector. In the upper-levels, southwest flow was over the Plains. A low was embedded within a longwave trough over the Western U.S., and was making its way from Utah into Colorado. A shortwave trough orbiting the low was ejecting over the Plains. The storm that produced the severe hail was elevated as the temperature at Hayes, Kansas was only 59 degrees just prior to this storm forming, with winds from the east-northeast at 20 kt, gusting to 26 kt. MUCAPE was near 1250 J/kg, with effective deep layer shear near 65 kt.",304

A small cluster of severe multicell thunderstorms formed over northwest Kansas during the late afternoon hours. This cluster moved east across north central Kansas during the evening hours, following Interstate 70. As this occurred, a fairly large shield of enhanced stratiform rain developed to its north, encompassing all of north central Kansas. As the western edge of this rain shield progressed eastward, radar showed a small area of rapidly eroding reflectivity over Mitchell County, especially above 30 dBZ. This was evidence of subsidence associated with microphysical processes, the evaporation of cloud and precipitation particles, and the formation of a wake low. While several mesonet stations, and a couple airports, experienced large pressure plunges, only two stations measured significant winds. The highest gust was 58 mph in the town of Glen Elder. This station also indicated a temperature increase from 65 to 74 degrees, and a drop in dewpoint temperature from 63 to 56 degrees, immediately after the peak wind. Ten miles to the east, the anemometer at the Beloit airport measured 53 mph. The altimeter dropped from 29.58 to 29.43 inches in just 5 minutes (from 1125 to 1130 PM CST).
