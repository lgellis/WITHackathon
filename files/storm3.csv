Although ground-truth storm reports were limited, quarter size hail was reported shortly after 4 p.m. CDT in rural southern Osborne County. As it turned out, this limited North Central Kansas activity was actually the northward extent of a more widespread area of strong to severe storms that mainly impacted portions of central and northeastern Kansas. ||The first storm formed near the Osborne-Russell County line between 3:30-4:00 p.m. CDT and quickly intensified as it drifted northeast, yielding the aforementioned report of quarter-size hail. Over the course of the next few hours, this initial isolated storm quickly morphed/grew upscale into a cluster of multicell convection that propagated east-northeast along various outflow boundaries, passing through portions of Mitchell and Jewell counties along the way.  By 7 p.m. CDT, storms had all but vacated this North Central Kansas area, although they persisted just off to the south and east for a few more hours. This event was a classic case of intense heating (and associated steep low-level lapse rates) along with subtle surface convergence coming together to ignite vigorous convection despite an overall-lack of large-scale forcing. In the mid-upper levels, flow was seasonably-weak as the Central Plains resided within a northward-building ridge axis, well-downstream from a broad trough axis near the Pacific Coast. At the surface, a fairly subtle northwest-southeast oriented confluence zone set up across the area during the afternoon, providing subtle lift. As temperatures soared to between 100-105 F, the intense heating and subtle convergence was sufficient to pop storms. Around the time of the Osborne County hail report, mesoscale parameters featured considerable instability with mixed-layer CAPE around 3000 J/kg, but no more than 20-25 knots of deep-layer wind shear.",36

According to radar data and very limited ground-truth, the only severe storm to impact this portion of North Central Kansas initiated over far northeastern Phillips County between 5:00-5:30 p.m. CDT. It then expanded in size during the next 90 minutes, drifting slowly westward through the county before eventually weakening somewhat around 7 p.m. CDT as it merged with a larger storm complex near the Norton County line. Along the way, quarter size hail was reported 13 miles northeast of Phillipsburg. Despite a lack of ground-truth rainfall and flooding reports from northern Phillips County, radar estimated that at least 1.50-3.00��� drenched the area mainly between 6-9 p.m. CDT, likely resulting in minor flooding issues. However, this heavy rain swath was the exception within these six counties, as most of southern Phillips, western Smith, Rooks and Osborne counties received less than 1��� of rain, with almost none whatsoever falling in Jewell, Mitchell and eastern Smith. ||Further examining the timing/evolution of convection within the local area, the aforementioned Phillips County severe storm was the first, semi-isolated storm of the day as it got underway between 5:00-5:30 p.m. CDT and started tracking west. Then between 6-8 p.m. CDT, a proliferation of outflow boundaries emanating from convection that initially developed in northwest and central Kansas resulted in a steady increase in storm coverage over Phillips and Rooks counties. During the following few hours, a north-south line of strong storms briefly organized over Osborne and western Smith counties but largely weakened by 10 p.m. CDT. Thereafter, only weak thunderstorm and widespread shower activity persisted within parts of the area into the very early morning hours of Saturday the 18th before dissipating and/or departing. This was a somewhat sneaky severe weather event considering that mid-upper level forcing and deep-layer wind shear were quite weak by mid-June standards (no more than 15-20 knots). However, this lack of forcing/shear was clearly compensated for by a potent level of instability/CAPE, climbing to at least 3000-4000 J/kg during the afternoon. These lofty instability values were not surprising considering that this was one of the hotter, more humid days of summer 2016 within North Central Kansas as temperatures generally topped out 99-102 F in the presence of dewpoints in the mid-60s. Because of this high instability/low shear setup, initially isolated multicell convection quickly became outflow-dominant, subsequently igniting increasingly-widespread storm development along a plethora of merging outflow boundaries. In the mid-upper levels, the weak flow and lack of large-scale forcing over the Central Plains was due to a broad ridge axis stretched from northern Mexico all the way into southeast Canada. At the surface, there were no pronounced boundaries of note over the local area as steady southeast breezes prevailed, although a somewhat subtle confluence zone was noted from central into northwest Kansas.",113

Although radar data suggested that severe-criteria wind and/or hail might have occurred, the only ground-truth report consisted of nickel size hail stones in rural southern Osborne County shortly before 6 p.m. CDT. ||These multicell storms initiated along a rather well-defined cold front tracking southeast through the Central Plains. Prior to the development of this stronger convection, much of the day featured hit-and-miss weak rain showers, rooted above a capping inversion. Eventually though, enough boundary-layer heating occurred just ahead of the front by late afternoon to allow more vigorous surface-based storm development, including the small cluster of convection in Osborne/Mitchell counties that initiated between 5:30-6:30 p.m. CDT, quickly peaked in intensity and had already started weakening by 7 p.m. CDT. These North Central Kansas storms were actually the northeastern extension of somewhat more widespread activity that focused within central and southwestern Kansas. After 7 p.m. CDT, numerous post-frontal rain showers and weak thunderstorms continued streaming over parts of the local area for several more hours, but nothing else came close to being strong/severe. This was a fairly common early-summer convective event for North Central Kansas, with low-level forcing focused along the aforementioned surface cold front. In the mid-upper levels, the Central Plains received a glancing shot of lift during the afternoon and evening from a vigorous low pressure system churning eastward along the North Dakota/Canada border area. The cap was finally able to break along the cold front as  surface temperatures climbed into the mid-90s F with dewpoints generally in the mid-60s. This yielded steep low-level lapse rates, with late afternoon mesoscale parameters featuring mixed-layer CAPE up to around 2000 J/kg but only fairly modest deep-layer wind shear to around 30 knots.",156

Thunderstorms affected portions of northwest Kansas as early as late afternoon, but north central Kansas was not impacted until later. Between 9 and 10 p.m. CST, scattered storms developed over Phillips, Rooks, and Osborne Counties. The only storm in which severe weather was reported was over northern Osborne County. Around 10:30 p.m. CST, the public estimated winds around 60 mph in the town of Osborne. A mesonet site from the Kansas State University, just northwest of town, measured 53 mph.||At dawn, a quasi-stationary front extended from the Ohio Valley through Missouri, turning northwest across northeast Kansas into south central Nebraska. This front lifted northeast as a warm front and was out of Kansas by midday. A very weak cold front was sagging southward through the Northern Plains. This front entered northern Nebraska during the afternoon and extended roughly along I-80, in Nebraska, from west to east by mid-evening. The upper levels were characterized by zonal flow, with a very slight trough over the Pacific Northwest and a slight ridge over the Great Lakes. Despite Kansas being just south of the Westerlies, a weak/subtle shortwave trough was moving through. This was a hot day, with high temperatures in the upper 90s to near 100, and dewpoints in the lower to middle 60s. However, by the time thunderstorms began developing, temperatures had cooled into the lower 80s, and dewpoints had climbed upper 60s.

This was a very busy evening and night for thunderstorms over Nebraska. Three individual squall lines formed from northeast to southwest, two of which evolved into small-scale bow echoes. The southernmost bow echo began as a small cluster of storms early in the evening, just north of the state line in southwest Nebraska. By 9 p.m. CST, the bow echo had formed in the McCook vicinity, with a measured gust of 62 mph at the McCook airport, at 8:58 p.m. CST. This bow echo expanded in size and tracked mostly across south central Nebraska, between Interstate 80 and the Kansas state line. Shortly after 10 p.m. CST, the gust front penetrated north Phillips County, and by 11 p.m. CST, thunderstorms at the tail end of the bow crossed the state line into northeast Phillips County. These storms advanced into Smith and Jewell Counties through 2 a.m. CST, gradually becoming oriented from west to east before exiting north central Kansas. A mesonet station a few miles northwest of Lebanon measured a gust of 62 mph a little before midnight CST. ||A very weak cold front sagged into Nebraska the previous night and was located roughly along the northern Kansas border daybreak Wednesday. As the day progressed, the front gradually lifted north as a warm front as low pressure over Wyoming deepened to 1000 mb. In the upper levels, the flow was zonal with the Westerlies confined to the northern third of the United States. A subtropical high was over Texas. 500 mb observations suggest there was a weak/subtle shortwave trough moving across the Central Plains, possibly aiding thunderstorm development. Just prior to thunderstorms moving into north central Kansas, temperatures were in the upper 70s, and dewpoints were around 70. Yet, mid-level lapse rates were very steep (8 degrees C/km), resulting in MLCAPE between 2000 and 4000 J/kg. Effective deep layer shear was around 50 kts.",305
