A Kansas Mesonet gauge in Osborne recorded 1.77 inches between 12:15 p.m. and 1 p.m. CDT...a span of 45 minutes. This mesonet ended up with a 24-hour total of 3.21 as of 6 a.m. CDT on the 25th, but the majority of this fell during the afternoon of the 24th (an additional 0.70 inches fell overnight into the 25th). In addition, a CoCoRaHS station in Osborne reported a 24-hour total of 2.95 as of 7 a.m. CDT on the 25th.","During mainly an 18-hour period from the late morning of Wednesday the 24th into the pre-dawn hours of Thursday the 25th, two separate rounds of rain (the first one being the heaviest/most significant) affected nearly this entire six-county North Central Kansas area. While most places tallied only 0.50-1.50 in total, a rather narrow, southwest-northeast swath centered through western/northern Osborne County into far southwestern Jewell County picked up higher amounts into the 2.00-3.50 range, resulting in both short-term areal flooding and also minor flooding along the South Fork Solomon River from near Alton downstream through the Osborne area. Officially, 18-24 hour rainfall totals featured 3.21 at a Kansas Mesonet site on the north side of Osborne and 2.95 at an Osborne CoCoRaHS station. This was almost entirely a heavy rain event, with only one report of nickel size hail between Osborne and Downs shortly before 1 p.m. CDT. ||The first round of rain (round 1) was by far the most significant and occurred mainly between the mid-morning and early afternoon hours. A slow-moving multicell storm cluster initially flared up over western Osborne County between 11 a.m. and noon CDT, then drifted through northern Osborne County into Jewell County before weakening and eventually departing the local area between 2-3 p.m. CDT. This round 1 dumped generally 1.50 to 3 over the heart of this swath, including 2.50 at the Kansas Mesonet site in Osborne (1.77 of which fell in 45 minutes) and an unofficial public report of 3.5 south of Alton. As a result, fairly significant short term flooding (including street flooding) ensued during the early afternoon. While most of this initial flooding abated within a few hours, enough runoff eventually drained into the South Fork Solomon River to push the automated gauge at Osborne above its minor flood stage of 14 feet by 7 p.m. CDT. Although not as impactful as round 1, another batch of light to moderate rain blossomed across nearly all of North Central Kansas mainly between 1-6 a.m. CDT on the 25th, leaving behind another widespread 0.50-1.00, including 0.70 at the Kansas Mesonet site in Osborne. If nothing else, round 2 kept the South Fork Solomon River above flood stage a bit longer, as the Osborne gauge crested at 15.8 feet (1.8 ft. above flood stage) at 12:45 a.m. CDT on the 25th but didn't drop below flood stage until 12 hours later. ||Briefly looking at the meteorological background of this small-scale flooding event, the Central Plains was under a seasonably-active southwesterly flow regime in the mid-upper levels as a series of low-amplitude disturbances streamed overhead, well to the south of a parent low centered in far south central Canada. At the surface, North Central Kansas was positioned slightly north of a quasi-stationary front stretched across southern and eastern Kansas. Despite seasonably-low mixed-layer CAPE averaging under 1000 J/kg, the combination of fairly strong mid-upper flow and a deep, moist airmass characterized by precipitable water values around 1.5 helped fuel the heavy rain.",94

Isolated thunderstorms initiated over northwest Kansas late Saturday afternoon, near the Nebraska state line. Initially, the first storms moved to the northeast, but then they slowed and began drifting to the southeast. Other storms began developing around 6 p.m. CST, and exhibited multi-cell characteristics. By 8 p.m. CST, multiple cell mergers had resulted in a pair of small thunderstorm clusters oriented west-northwest to east-southeast, from Hitchcock County Nebraska to Graham County Kansas. Shortly thereafter, other storms erupted between these two clusters, resulting in the completion of a common cold pool. The westernmost cluster, over Hitchcock and Red Willow Counties in Nebraska, became mobile and accelerated to the southeast, merging with downstream storms, and eventually evolving into a short squall line affecting Rooks and Osborne Counties in north central Kansas. The southern edge of the cold pool remained quasi-stationary, with storms propagating southeastward along and to the north of it. Repeated thunderstorm activity, as well as the slow movement of the storms, resulted in excessive rainfall over Rooks and Osborne Counties as well as several other counties to the south, west, and northwest. The squall line took nearly 2.5 hours to cross Rooks County, moving at a speed near 16 mph. Three to seven inches of rain fell across portions of Phillips, Rooks, and Osborne Counties in less than six hours. Flash flooding resulted in numerous roads covered by water in Phillips and Rooks Counties. Some culverts were even washed out in parts of Rooks County. The runoff into the basin of the North Fork of the Solomon River resulted in rapid rises. At the river gauge near the town of Glade, the river had been running a little below 3 feet in the preceding days. Water levels began rising at that gauge early Sunday afternoon. In less than 3 hours, the river reached bankfull and went into flood at 11 feet. The crest occurred Sunday night with major flooding occurring. Soil moisture had been at or above normal preceding this event, with above normal rainfall over much of north central Kansas in the month of August.||This event occurred in the warm sector of a low pressure system over central Canada. Its trailing cold front was well-upstream from the Dakota's southwest into the Nebraska Panhandle, then west through Wyoming into Utah. High pressure was over the Northeast United States. An anomalous moisture plume existed in the return flow over the Plains. The 00Z Dodge City sounding indicated a precipitable water value of 1.46 inches, which was above the 90th percentile of all PW observations for the date. West-southwest flow prevailed aloft from the Desert Southwest to the Great Lakes, with a longwave trough along the West Coast, and a ridge over the eastern United States. A weak/subtle shortwave trough appeared to be moving through. Just prior to the thunderstorms moving into north central Kansas, temperatures were in the 70s, with dewpoints in the lower to middle 60s.

The runoff from this rain resulted in major flooding of the North Fork Solomon River. The river gauge located just south of Glade was above flood stage of 11 feet for almost 48 hours, and a new record crest occurred with a stage of 18.55 feet at 1:45 a.m. CST on September 5th. Area roads already affected by flash flooding during the early morning hours of the 4th saw no relief as the water upstream passed through, and a Labor Day event in the town of Logan was cancelled due to area road conditions.","Excessive rainfall resulted in flash flooding and river flooding on this Saturday night, with the river flooding lasting into Tuesday. Isolated thunderstorms initiated over northwest Kansas late Saturday afternoon, near the Nebraska state line. Initially, the first storms moved to the northeast, but then they slowed and began drifting to the southeast. Other storms began developing around 6 p.m. CST, and exhibited multi-cell characteristics. By 8 p.m. CST, multiple cell mergers had resulted in a pair of small thunderstorm clusters oriented west-northwest to east-southeast, from Hitchcock County Nebraska to Graham County Kansas. Shortly thereafter, other storms erupted between these two clusters, resulting in the completion of a common cold pool. The westernmost cluster, over Hitchcock and Red Willow Counties in Nebraska, became mobile and accelerated to the southeast, merging with downstream storms, and eventually evolving into a short squall line affecting Rooks and Osborne Counties in north central Kansas. The southern edge of the cold pool remained quasi-stationary, with storms propagating southeastward along and to the north of it. Repeated thunderstorm activity, as well as the slow movement of the storms, resulted in excessive rainfall over Rooks and Osborne Counties as well as several other counties to the south, west, and northwest. The squall line took nearly 2.5 hours to cross Rooks County, moving at a speed near 16 mph. Three to seven inches of rain fell across portions of Phillips, Rooks, and Osborne Counties in less than six hours. Flash flooding resulted in numerous roads covered by water in Phillips and Rooks Counties. Some culverts were even washed out in parts of Rooks County. The runoff into the basin of the North Fork of the Solomon River resulted in rapid rises. At the river gauge near the town of Glade, the river had been running a little below 3 feet in the preceding days. Water levels began rising at that gauge early Sunday afternoon. In less than 3 hours, the river reached bankfull and went into flood at 11 feet. The crest occurred Sunday night with major flooding occurring. Soil moisture had been at or above normal preceding this event, with above normal rainfall over much of north central Kansas in the month of August.||This event occurred in the warm sector of a low pressure system over central Canada. Its trailing cold front was well-upstream from the Dakota's southwest into the Nebraska Panhandle, then west through Wyoming into Utah. High pressure was over the Northeast United States. An anomalous moisture plume existed in the return flow over the Plains. The 00Z Dodge City sounding indicated a precipitable water value of 1.46 inches, which was above the 90th percentile of all PW observations for the date. West-southwest flow prevailed aloft from the Desert Southwest to the Great Lakes, with a longwave trough along the West Coast, and a ridge over the eastern United States. A weak/subtle shortwave trough appeared to be moving through. Just prior to the thunderstorms moving into north central Kansas, temperatures were in the 70s, with dewpoints in the lower to middle 60s. Mid-level lapse rates were poor, but MUCAPE was still 1000-1500 J/kg. The low-level jet was 35-40 knots over western Kansas. Effective deep layer shear was between 40 and 45 knots, despite weak mid-level winds.",224
