This area of low pressure, and upper level low, ejected northeastward across western Kansas the night of the 1st, and towards the state of Iowa through Feb 2nd. Winds shifted to more of a southeasterly direction as the low moved northeast then to more of a northerly direction behind this system. Mid-level frontogenesis developed across west central Kansas the morning of Feb 1st, then stretched northeastward throughout the day. Precipitation started falling across west central Kansas during the morning hours, initially as rain. This precipitation then changed over to snow by the afternoon. A second band of precipitation fell across far southwestern Kansas in the afternoon with snow reported across far western Kansas, changing over to rain to the east. This band of precipitation shifted eastward in the evening with snow across a majority of western and northern Kansas with rain across central Kansas. As temperatures dropped overnight, precipitation fell as snow farther east. Snow was reported across northern Kansas around sunrise of the 2nd and continued into throughout the day. A few light snow showers fell across portions of west central Kansas, but tapered off by late afternoon. Snow showers then moved out of the area the evening of the 2nd. As for snow fall totals, 2 inches of snow generally fell across areas north and west of a line from Hoisington, KS to Jetmore, KS to Syracuse, KS. Snowfall amounts of over 6 inches fell in portions of Scott, Lane, Ness, Rush, and Trego counties. The highest snowfall amount reported was 9 inches ten miles south of Collyer, KS.",25

Little to no snow accumulation took place through the day, although by 730 p.m. a spotter in Long Island reported 1-2. During the pre-dawn hours of the 2nd, conditions went downhill fast across most of the area as an organized, large band of moderate to heavy snow lifted across the area from south-to-north, driven by increasing synoptic-scale forcing to the north of a powerful, closed mid-level low churning into southwestern Kansas. At the same time, north-northeast winds continued ramping up in response to surface low pressure deepening to around 994 millibars over central Kansas by daybreak. Across most of the six-county area, the majority of snow had already fallen by sunrise, as most of the steady accumulation during the daytime and evening hours of the 2nd focused north of the state line in Nebraska.

This front trailed southward from a deep, roughly 990 millibar surface low that tracked across northern South Dakota during the night. In the mid-levels, and slightly south of the surface low track, a compact-but-strong disturbance moved along the NE/SD border area. One of the most striking features of this event was the intensity of winds a few thousand feet above the surface, as speeds at the 850 millibar level peaked at 60-80 knots. Fortunately, limited nocturnal mixing was unable to usher the full ferocity of these potentially very damaging winds down to the surface.",40

Like the event two days prior, the majority of severe weather again targeted Jewell County. There were actually two separate rounds of severe storms on this day, one during the pre-dawn hours and another during the late afternoon/early evening. The early morning storms were classic, elevated hail producers that flared up between 2-5 a.m. CDT, highlighted by a supercell that dumped quarter to golf ball size hail on the town of Jewell for 20 minutes around 3 a.m. CDT. After these early morning storms exited to the north and east by 5 a.m. CDT, most of the day featured a solid lull before the mid/late afternoon redevelopment. During the afternoon/evening event, Jewell County was again the primary action zone as a few severe storms tracked through between 4:30-7:30 p.m. CDT, yielding ping pong ball size hail near Lovewell Reservoir and again dropping quarter size hail in Jewell. As it turned out, the only local severe weather report outside of Jewell County on this day was the aforementioned brief, EF0-rated tornado which touched down shortly before 8 p.m. CDT in a rural area near the Phillips/Smith County line, roughly 10 miles north of Kensington. This tornado caused no known damage as it developed from what appeared to be a tiny supercell storm along the southern edge of a larger storm complex centered to the north in Nebraska. Later in the night, more widespread showers and storms blossomed across North Central Kansas, but these were non-severe and produced only rain and possibly some small hail. Rainfall-wise, the majority of the six-county area averaged well-under 1 inch for the event. However, a fairly narrow corridor of eastern Jewell County registered 24-hour totals of 1.50-3.00, including 2.99 in Jewell and 2.67 near Webber. Most of this rain fell between 6-8 p.m. CDT under a persistent narrow line of strong to severe storms. However, there were no reports of impactful flooding. ||This was a well-anticipated, synoptically evident severe weather event, as a large, deep trough ejected out of the Central/Southern Rockies into the Central/Southern Plains in a neutral-to-slightly negatively-tilted orientation. During the initial round of early morning hailers, the local area was positioned just north of a well-defined surface stationary front stretched from west-east near the Interstate 70 corridor, with convection driven by classic warm air/moisture advection at the nose of a 40 knot low level jet and in the presence of healthy elevated most-unstable CAPE around 2000 J/kg. By the time of afternoon redevelopment, a 996 millibar surface low was positioned just south of North Central Kansas, with the associated quasi-stationary front barely lifting north into the local area. Late afternoon surface observations from Beloit and Smith Center revealed temperatures in the mid-upper 70s F, dewpoints in the low 60s and modest east-southeast breezes. Mesoscale parameters were more than sufficient for severe storms, featuring at least 2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and deep-layer wind shear of 50-60 knots. However, the low-mid level wind profile proved rather inhospitable to longer-lived, discrete supercell storms, instead favoring clusters/line segments. For days leading up to the 26th, there was considerable speculation in some weather circles about this being a major severe weather/tornado outbreak through much of the Central Plains. This perception was fueled when the Storm Prediction Center placed much of central/eastern Kansas under a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks issued on the 25th and maintained this level 4 category through most of the Day 1 period. As it turned out, although there were numerous reports of primarily large hail in parts of central and eastern Kansas, fortunately a number of factors (including predominant storm mode) held a significant tornado outbreak at bay.",211

Like the event two days prior, the majority of severe weather again targeted Jewell County. There were actually two separate rounds of severe storms on this day, one during the pre-dawn hours and another during the late afternoon/early evening. The early morning storms were classic, elevated hail producers that flared up between 2-5 a.m. CDT, highlighted by a supercell that dumped quarter to golf ball size hail on the town of Jewell for 20 minutes around 3 a.m. CDT. After these early morning storms exited to the north and east by 5 a.m. CDT, most of the day featured a solid lull before the mid/late afternoon redevelopment. During the afternoon/evening event, Jewell County was again the primary action zone as a few severe storms tracked through between 4:30-7:30 p.m. CDT, yielding ping pong ball size hail near Lovewell Reservoir and again dropping quarter size hail in Jewell. As it turned out, the only local severe weather report outside of Jewell County on this day was the aforementioned brief, EF0-rated tornado which touched down shortly before 8 p.m. CDT in a rural area near the Phillips/Smith County line, roughly 10 miles north of Kensington. This tornado caused no known damage as it developed from what appeared to be a tiny supercell storm along the southern edge of a larger storm complex centered to the north in Nebraska. Later in the night, more widespread showers and storms blossomed across North Central Kansas, but these were non-severe and produced only rain and possibly some small hail. Rainfall-wise, the majority of the six-county area averaged well-under 1 inch for the event. However, a fairly narrow corridor of eastern Jewell County registered 24-hour totals of 1.50-3.00, including 2.99 in Jewell and 2.67 near Webber. Most of this rain fell between 6-8 p.m. CDT under a persistent narrow line of strong to severe storms. However, there were no reports of impactful flooding. ||This was a well-anticipated, synoptically evident severe weather event, as a large, deep trough ejected out of the Central/Southern Rockies into the Central/Southern Plains in a neutral-to-slightly negatively-tilted orientation. During the initial round of early morning hailers, the local area was positioned just north of a well-defined surface stationary front stretched from west-east near the Interstate 70 corridor, with convection driven by classic warm air/moisture advection at the nose of a 40 knot low level jet and in the presence of healthy elevated most-unstable CAPE around 2000 J/kg. By the time of afternoon redevelopment, a 996 millibar surface low was positioned just south of North Central Kansas, with the associated quasi-stationary front barely lifting north into the local area. Late afternoon surface observations from Beloit and Smith Center revealed temperatures in the mid-upper 70s F, dewpoints in the low 60s and modest east-southeast breezes. Mesoscale parameters were more than sufficient for severe storms, featuring at least 2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and deep-layer wind shear of 50-60 knots. However, the low-mid level wind profile proved rather inhospitable to longer-lived, discrete supercell storms, instead favoring clusters/line segments. For days leading up to the 26th, there was considerable speculation in some weather circles about this being a major severe weather/tornado outbreak through much of the Central Plains. This perception was fueled when the Storm Prediction Center placed much of central/eastern Kansas under a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks issued on the 25th and maintained this level 4 category through most of the Day 1 period. As it turned out, although there were numerous reports of primarily large hail in parts of central and eastern Kansas, fortunately a number of factors (including predominant storm mode) held a significant tornado outbreak at bay.",262

Like the event two days prior, the majority of severe weather again targeted Jewell County. There were actually two separate rounds of severe storms on this day, one during the pre-dawn hours and another during the late afternoon/early evening. The early morning storms were classic, elevated hail producers that flared up between 2-5 a.m. CDT, highlighted by a supercell that dumped quarter to golf ball size hail on the town of Jewell for 20 minutes around 3 a.m. CDT. After these early morning storms exited to the north and east by 5 a.m. CDT, most of the day featured a solid lull before the mid/late afternoon redevelopment. During the afternoon/evening event, Jewell County was again the primary action zone as a few severe storms tracked through between 4:30-7:30 p.m. CDT, yielding ping pong ball size hail near Lovewell Reservoir and again dropping quarter size hail in Jewell. As it turned out, the only local severe weather report outside of Jewell County on this day was the aforementioned brief, EF0-rated tornado which touched down shortly before 8 p.m. CDT in a rural area near the Phillips/Smith County line, roughly 10 miles north of Kensington. This tornado caused no known damage as it developed from what appeared to be a tiny supercell storm along the southern edge of a larger storm complex centered to the north in Nebraska. Later in the night, more widespread showers and storms blossomed across North Central Kansas, but these were non-severe and produced only rain and possibly some small hail. Rainfall-wise, the majority of the six-county area averaged well-under 1 inch for the event. However, a fairly narrow corridor of eastern Jewell County registered 24-hour totals of 1.50-3.00, including 2.99 in Jewell and 2.67 near Webber. Most of this rain fell between 6-8 p.m. CDT under a persistent narrow line of strong to severe storms. However, there were no reports of impactful flooding. ||This was a well-anticipated, synoptically evident severe weather event, as a large, deep trough ejected out of the Central/Southern Rockies into the Central/Southern Plains in a neutral-to-slightly negatively-tilted orientation. During the initial round of early morning hailers, the local area was positioned just north of a well-defined surface stationary front stretched from west-east near the Interstate 70 corridor, with convection driven by classic warm air/moisture advection at the nose of a 40 knot low level jet and in the presence of healthy elevated most-unstable CAPE around 2000 J/kg. By the time of afternoon redevelopment, a 996 millibar surface low was positioned just south of North Central Kansas, with the associated quasi-stationary front barely lifting north into the local area. Late afternoon surface observations from Beloit and Smith Center revealed temperatures in the mid-upper 70s F, dewpoints in the low 60s and modest east-southeast breezes. Mesoscale parameters were more than sufficient for severe storms, featuring at least 2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and deep-layer wind shear of 50-60 knots. However, the low-mid level wind profile proved rather inhospitable to longer-lived, discrete supercell storms, instead favoring clusters/line segments. For days leading up to the 26th, there was considerable speculation in some weather circles about this being a major severe weather/tornado outbreak through much of the Central Plains. This perception was fueled when the Storm Prediction Center placed much of central/eastern Kansas under a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks issued on the 25th and maintained this level 4 category through most of the Day 1 period.

Like the event two days prior, the majority of severe weather again targeted Jewell County. There were actually two separate rounds of severe storms on this day, one during the pre-dawn hours and another during the late afternoon/early evening. The early morning storms were classic, elevated hail producers that flared up between 2-5 a.m. CDT, highlighted by a supercell that dumped quarter to golf ball size hail on the town of Jewell for 20 minutes around 3 a.m. CDT. After these early morning storms exited to the north and east by 5 a.m. CDT, most of the day featured a solid lull before the mid/late afternoon redevelopment. During the afternoon/evening event, Jewell County was again the primary action zone as a few severe storms tracked through between 4:30-7:30 p.m. CDT, yielding ping pong ball size hail near Lovewell Reservoir and again dropping quarter size hail in Jewell. As it turned out, the only local severe weather report outside of Jewell County on this day was the aforementioned brief, EF0-rated tornado which touched down shortly before 8 p.m. CDT in a rural area near the Phillips/Smith County line, roughly 10 miles north of Kensington. This tornado caused no known damage as it developed from what appeared to be a tiny supercell storm along the southern edge of a larger storm complex centered to the north in Nebraska. Later in the night, more widespread showers and storms blossomed across North Central Kansas, but these were non-severe and produced only rain and possibly some small hail. Rainfall-wise, the majority of the six-county area averaged well-under 1 inch for the event. However, a fairly narrow corridor of eastern Jewell County registered 24-hour totals of 1.50-3.00, including 2.99 in Jewell and 2.67 near Webber. Most of this rain fell between 6-8 p.m. CDT under a persistent narrow line of strong to severe storms. However, there were no reports of impactful flooding. ||This was a well-anticipated, synoptically evident severe weather event, as a large, deep trough ejected out of the Central/Southern Rockies into the Central/Southern Plains in a neutral-to-slightly negatively-tilted orientation. During the initial round of early morning hailers, the local area was positioned just north of a well-defined surface stationary front stretched from west-east near the Interstate 70 corridor, with convection driven by classic warm air/moisture advection at the nose of a 40 knot low level jet and in the presence of healthy elevated most-unstable CAPE around 2000 J/kg. By the time of afternoon redevelopment, a 996 millibar surface low was positioned just south of North Central Kansas, with the associated quasi-stationary front barely lifting north into the local area. Late afternoon surface observations from Beloit and Smith Center revealed temperatures in the mid-upper 70s F, dewpoints in the low 60s and modest east-southeast breezes. Mesoscale parameters were more than sufficient for severe storms, featuring at least 2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and deep-layer wind shear of 50-60 knots. However, the low-mid level wind profile proved rather inhospitable to longer-lived, discrete supercell storms, instead favoring clusters/line segments. For days leading up to the 26th, there was considerable speculation in some weather circles about this being a major severe weather/tornado outbreak through much of the Central Plains. This perception was fueled when the Storm Prediction Center placed much of central/eastern Kansas under a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks issued on the 25th and maintained this level 4 category through most of the Day 1 period.

This storm was producing a tornado upon entering Rooks County, but the tornado quickly dissipated after crossing into the County. This supercell cycled and did spawn another short-track EF-1 tornado just northeast of where the previous tornado ended. This storm then merged with the developing squall line which swept east across the rest of north central Kansas. Severe hail was reported in many locations across Rooks, Osborne, and Mitchell Counties, the largest of which was 2 inches over west-central Osborne County. This line of storms exited north central Kansas by 11 p.m. CST. However, new severe thunderstorms were already developing to the southwest, apparently along the outflow boundary left by the preceding storms. These storms produced hail up to the size of golf balls in multiple locations between 11:15 p.m. and 12:30 a.m. CST. Cell training occurred with these storms and, when combined with the previous line, a CoCoRaHS observer measured 3.77 inches of rain which fell in less than 12 hours.||A low pressure center was located over western Kansas.

These storms developed in the vicinity of this front and in the warm sector. Prior to convective initiation, temperatures were in the middle 70s with dewpoints in the middle 50s. Mid-level lapse rates were very steep, between 8 and 8.5 degrees C/km, resulting in MLCAPE between 1500 and 2000 J/kg. Effective deep layer shear was between 35 and 40 knots.

Thunderstorms had developed over western Kansas by mid-afternoon and, by 5:30 p.m. CST, they began moving into north central Kansas. The storms were mostly short line-segments of multicell storms, but there was one supercell that lifted out of Ellis County into southeastern Rooks County. This storm was producing a tornado upon entering Rooks County, but the tornado quickly dissipated after crossing into the County. This supercell cycled and did spawn another short-track EF-1 tornado just northeast of where the previous tornado ended. This storm then merged with the developing squall line which swept east across the rest of north central Kansas. Severe hail was reported in many locations across Rooks, Osborne, and Mitchell Counties, the largest of which was 2 inches over west-central Osborne County. This line of storms exited north central Kansas by 11 p.m. CST. However, new severe thunderstorms were already developing to the southwest, apparently along the outflow boundary left by the preceding storms. These storms produced hail up to the size of golf balls in multiple locations between 11:15 p.m. and 12:30 a.m. CST. Cell training occurred with these storms and, when combined with the previous line, a CoCoRaHS observer measured 3.77 inches of rain which fell in less than 12 hours.||A low pressure center was located over western Kansas.
