Around 230 pm CST, scattered slow-moving thunderstorms began forming along a line across Rooks and Osborne Counties. Around 330 pm CST, the storm over eastern Rooks County intensified and produced hail up to the size of half dollars. This storm probably remained severe until 4 pm CST as it sagged slowly south. However, no additional reports were received due to the sparsity of population. After 330 pm CST, numerous other storms smaller storms developed across north central Kansas, south of Highway 36. A couple of these storms briefly turned severe over Mitchell County, with 1 inch hail reported in Cawker City around 4 pm CST, and in Hunter around 5 pm CST. The storms generally weakened after 5 pm, leaving stratiform anvil rain, with strongest storms just east and south of this portion of north central Kansas. ||These storms formed along an extensive cool front that extended from Nevada to New Jersey. This front was stationary in some locations, with weak lows migrating east along it. Part of this front was sagging south through north central Kansas. In the upper-levels, the main band of Westerlies was along the U.S.-Canada border with the amplitude fairly low. However, during the day, a shortwave trough migrated from the Northern Rockies into the Dakota's and Nebraska and exhibited some amplification. Two subtropical highs were over the southern U.S. Just prior to thunderstorm initiation, temperatures were around 100 with dewpoints ranging from the upper 50s to lower 70s. Northeast winds behind the front were advecting rich dewpoints westward. MLCAPE ranged from 1000 to 3000 J/kg, with the lowest values associated with the lowest dewpoints, and the highest values associated with the highest dewpoints.

The result was businesses in that area becoming inundated with several feet of running water. Numerous car dealerships saw much of their merchandise go underwater at that location.
