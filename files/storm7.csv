A few other storms developed within the local area over the ensuing few hours, but none became severe. ||Briefly examining the meteorological setup, northern Kansas was under broad quasi-zonal flow in the mid-upper levels containing subtle embedded disturbances . At the surface, the highest low-level moisture levels and resultant instability values focused to the south of a quasi-stationary front stretched from central Kansas into southeast Nebraska. However, this particular severe storm still managed to develop within the northern fringes of the surface frontal zone, possibly enhanced by outflow emanating northward from a large severe storm that earlier formed over Ellis County. Around the time of the Rooks County hail, the mesoscale environment featured approximately 2500 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 35 knots of effective deep layer wind shear.",189
