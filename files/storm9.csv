A 24-hour rain total of 4.95 was reported six miles east of Phillipsburg, most of which fell between 10 p.m. and midnight CDT. During this same time frame, a county deputy encountered around one foot of water flowing over Highway 183 near Glade. When combined with rain from the previous night, the aforementioned station east of Phillipsburg totaled a hefty 48-hour amount of 6.61. Although two-day totals this high were the exception within the area, widespread two-day tallies of at least 3-5 (especially within southern and eastern Phillips County) were common, and this instigated at least minor flooding along several creeks and rivers. At some point between the late evening of the 2nd and Wednesday the 4th, flooding was indicated by automated gauges and/or ground-truth along the following waterways: North Fork Solomon River near Glade (upstream of Kirwin Reservoir), North Fork Solomon River near Portis (upstream of Waconda Lake), South Fork Solomon River near Damar (upstream of Webster Reservoir), Bow Creek in southern Phillips/northern Rooks counties, and Deer Creek and Big Creek in Phillips County. ||Things first got underway between 5:30-7:30 p.m. CDT as a few semi-discrete storms blossomed in the general vicinity of a near-stationary surface front.

After midnight CDT, convection diminished in intensity but another line of gradually-weakening storms slowly pushed in from the west, dropping more rain on already-saturated areas before dissipating completely by 6 a.m. CDT on the 3rd. In the mid-upper levels, the setup was much the same as the previous night, as small-scale waves continued ejecting through the Central Plains in enhanced southwesterly flow, emanating from a large-scale trough anchored over the Northern Rockies. At the surface, the cold front which pushed through much of the area the preceding night stalled out and even retreated back to the northwest somewhat during the day and evening, providing an obvious southwest-northeast oriented focus for convection. Low-level moisture was high by October standards across North Central Kansas, with surface dewpoints commonly in the low-mid 60s F.

Hail to at least quarter size was reported in or near Downs, Burr Oak, and Ionia, with larger golf ball size stones near Hunter. In addition, a southwest-northeast oriented swath of heavy rainfall of mainly 2-3 fell across the heart of Mitchell County, including a CoCoRaHS total of 3.20 a few miles north of Hunter. However, there were no ground-truth reports of flooding. ||Turning to event evolution, the first attempts at convective initiation within North Central Kansas occurred as early as 3-4 p.m. CDT, but yielded only a few non-severe storms. However, things soon turned much more active between 5:30-8:00 p.m. CDT as several strong to severe storms lifted north into the area out of central Kansas. This convection consisted of a varied mix of quasi-linear and semi-discrete modes, and even featured at least one embedded supercell that exhibited noticeable radar-indicated rotation as it traversed southern and eastern Mitchell County. However, no tornadic activity was reported. By 8 p.m. CDT, all severe storms had departed off to the east, leaving only showers and non-severe storms lingering within the area until around midnight CDT. ||In the mid-upper levels, this was a strongly-forced event as a large-scale, increasingly-amplified trough traversed the Central Plains from the 6th into the 7th. At the surface, severe convection in North Central Kansas focused mainly just north of a well-defined quasi-stationary front stretched from southwest Kansas to southeast Nebraska. Low-level moisture was abundant across the local area, with surface dewpoints well into the mid-60s to around 70F.

Hail to at least quarter size was reported in or near Downs, Burr Oak, and Ionia, with larger golf ball size stones near Hunter. In addition, a southwest-northeast oriented swath of heavy rainfall of mainly 2-3 fell across the heart of Mitchell County, including a CoCoRaHS total of 3.20 a few miles north of Hunter. However, there were no ground-truth reports of flooding. ||Turning to event evolution, the first attempts at convective initiation within North Central Kansas occurred as early as 3-4 p.m. CDT, but yielded only a few non-severe storms. However, things soon turned much more active between 5:30-8:00 p.m. CDT as several strong to severe storms lifted north into the area out of central Kansas. This convection consisted of a varied mix of quasi-linear and semi-discrete modes, and even featured at least one embedded supercell that exhibited noticeable radar-indicated rotation as it traversed southern and eastern Mitchell County. However, no tornadic activity was reported. By 8 p.m. CDT, all severe storms had departed off to the east, leaving only showers and non-severe storms lingering within the area until around midnight CDT. ||In the mid-upper levels, this was a strongly-forced event as a large-scale, increasingly-amplified trough traversed the Central Plains from the 6th into the 7th. At the surface, severe convection in North Central Kansas focused mainly just north of a well-defined quasi-stationary front stretched from southwest Kansas to southeast Nebraska. Low-level moisture was abundant across the local area, with surface dewpoints well into the mid-60s to around 70F. As severe storms entered the picture early in the evening, mesoscale analysis indicated around 1000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and strong effective deep-layer wind shear of at least 50 knots.",252
