The tornado then moved ESE and then east along a path around 1 mile south of Chapman destroying 1 farmstead and several other homes in the area.  The worst damage was done to a farmstead 1 mile southwest of Chapman along old highway 40 where the home was destroyed and all outbuildings were blown away.  The sub floor of the home was removed from a bolted sill plate and the poured concrete foundation was cracked on the south side exposing the rebar where the strongest forces from the lifting structure occurred as it was being removed and blown away likely occurred.  Much of the brick facade of the home did remain where it fell around the structure however so the area was not swept clean.

Many thunderstorms formed from central Kansas into northeast Kansas in the early- to mid-afternoon hours. Storms predominantly exhibited multicell storm mode. Around 2 p.m. CST, several new storms developed near Interstate 70, between Hayes and Russell. These storms quickly merged into a line and lifted into Osborne and Mitchell Counties shortly thereafter. This line continued lifting north over the following two hours, affecting Smith and Jewell Counties as well. These storms were mostly sub-severe, but one inch hail was reported in extreme northeast Smith County, just before the storms crossed the state line into Nebraska around 4 p.m. CST.||A quasi-stationary front extended from New Mexico across Kansas into Missouri. This front lifted north through the day as a warm front, but was effectively forced back to the south as thunderstorm outflows cooled temperatures over northern Kansas. In the upper levels, a longwave trough was over the western United States, with broad southwest flow from Texas to New England. A subtropical high was over the western Atlantic. During the day, a shortwave trough ejected out of the Desert Southwest into the Southern Plains, aiding in thunderstorm development. Just prior to thunderstorm initiation, temperatures were generally in the upper 70s to near 80, with dewpoints around 70. This surface environment was overlaid with very steep mid-level lapse rates around 9 degrees C/km, resulting in MLCAPE between 3000 and 4000 J/kg. Strong mid-level winds, combined with directional shear in the low-levels, produced effective deep layer shear between 40 and 50 knots.",313
